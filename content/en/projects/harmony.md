A copperplate engraving back from my school days.
I carved the pattern in several layers into a copperplate.
To achieve a different color tone, the plate was immersed in a chemical solution for several moments.
For the dotted pattern I used chalk, and for the hard outer lines I used a pointed needle.
Once I liked the pattern, printing could begin.
The plate was first heated so that the ink would adhere well and then inked with a roller.
After that, the plate was cleaned again.
At the end I placed the plate on a piece of paper and pushed it through a printing press with a lot of pressure.
