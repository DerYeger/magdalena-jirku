The result of my fifth university project.
The task was to create a video using motion graphics.
This project was done in collaboration with my colleague Atlanta Kyriakoulis.
After the concept was defined, I started creating the concept art.
I made several sketches of the product until we agreed on the final design.
Following with the 3D model, texturing, camera, lighting and composition techniques came into play.
Post-production was the most important part for this project.
All sequences were individually designed and motion graphics came into play.
After compositing was completed, the background music followed. The sound was created by Alex Omari, who matched it perfectly with our video.

Everything in this video is fictional, we did not use a pre-existing product.
This video was created for private use only, it's not a real commercial.
