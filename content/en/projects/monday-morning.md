My third university project was a short animated film, which was created in collaboration with a colleague from my university course.
It was our first 3D animated video.
Animatics, Storyboards, Rigging, Character Animation, Tracking Shots, Lighting and Rendering all made their first appearance here.
For the amount of time we were given, we took on a bit too much. Therefore, the video had to be shortened and the concept changed.
There are a lot of steps I would do differently now, but those steps are part of the learning process. :)
This video was made in collaboration with Atlanta Kyriakoulis.
