      This is the final project (diploma thesis) of my school days.
      My colleague Hana Stein and I decided to create a project about the alumni of «die Graphische».
      My task was to create a catalog for the exhibition while my colleague planned a fictional exhibition and transformed it into a three-dimensional space.
      Together, we wrote biographies about the artists who were once students at the school.
      We included artists like Trude Fleischmann or Margit Doppler, who were already creatively active in the 1910s and 1920s.
      In total, I assembled information about more than 30 artists, all of whom were immortalized in this catalog with their biographies and works.
