# About me

<p></p>

*Magdalena // 23 // Vienna // Graphic design // VFX & 3D Animation student at SAE*

I finished my graphic and communication design education at the «Höhere Graphische Bundes- Lehr und Versuchsanstalt» in 2018 in Vienna.
At the end of 2019 I started an education as a 3D Artist, with a focus on VFX (Visual Effects) and 3D Animation.
Coming August I will finish my diploma studies at the «SAE Institute» Vienna and continue this media branch with a bachelor.

In my free time I find my inspiration while walking in nature, skiing and biking, or drawing.
In 2012, I bought my first digital tablet, with which I still love to create illustrations.
Some of them can be seen in my hobby-work section.

My areas of responsibilities include graphic design and since early 2020 also visual effects and 3D animation.
I have already gained some practical experience on logo-, label- and bannerdesigns in various work environments.
