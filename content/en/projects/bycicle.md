The fourth university project was a 3D tracking project. The goal was to embed a 3D object into a real footage.
The object that I chose to track is a retro styled bicycle. The textures were later on generated in Substance Painter.
PFTrack was used to create the trackers, so that the object always stays at the same spot.
The final compositing steps were done in After Effects.
