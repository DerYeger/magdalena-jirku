      Creative is the result of my diploma project. The goal was to create an
      advertisement for a colored pencil case. The color scheme is colorful
      and playful, yet classy. The focus was to achieve a flow within the
      video, along with advertising and simulations. All content in this video
      except the audio track was created by me.
