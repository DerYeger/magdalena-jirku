My second university project had to be a 3D Diorama in a Low-Poly style.
While working on this project I gained my first 3D experiences, which is one of the reasons I kept the models very simple.
During this project, I also started to understand how UV cuts work and how to create simple High Poly models.
The style is very similar to that of comics. All textures that can be seen were created in Photoshop.
