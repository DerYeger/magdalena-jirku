The result of my diploma project during my studies at the SAE Institute.
With the help of brainstorming, I came up with the idea of creating a wooden pencil box for high quality manufactured colored pencils.
The scheme is colorful, playful and yet classy.
The logo was created in Illustrator.
The name is meant to combine art and creativity, which is why I chose a combination of the words «Creative» and «Art».
After the logo was created, the 3D model, including textures, followed.
Then lights and shadows were set.
The most exciting part took place in SideFX Houdini.
That is where the smoke volumes were created using Points and Attributes.
In post-production, the scenes were combined and harmonized.
Color grading, editing and sound were the final touches.

Everything in this video is fictional, I did not use a pre-existing product.
This video was created for private use only, it's not a real commercial.
