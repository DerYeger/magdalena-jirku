The final result of my first university project.
The goal was to create a 2D Environment in a Concept-Art Style.
I have been drawing digitally for some years now, but I have never done anything like this before.
Since I am a big fan of the norse mythology, I chose Jotunheim as my preferred destination.
It was my first time drawing snow, so it was a great opportunity for me to learn more about various materials and the change of weather.
