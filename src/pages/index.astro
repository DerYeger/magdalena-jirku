          Hi! I am Magdalena, a motion graphic designer based in Vienna, Austria.
          I love developing fun and colorful projects that allow me to combine my skills in both animation and illustration.
          Since 2023, I am working in the field of motion design as a professional and can't get enough of it!
          In my spare time I enjoy reading about new motion design trends and watching movies to keep in touch with the industry.
          I also love to go on walks with my camera and take pictures of interesting motives.
