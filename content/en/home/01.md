I finished my graphic and communication design education at the «Höhere Graphische Bundes- Lehr und Versuchsanstalt» in 2018 in Vienna.
At the end of 2019 I started an education as a 3D Artist, with a focus on VFX (Visual Effects) and 3D Animation.
Coming August I will finish my diploma studies at the «SAE Institute» Vienna and continue this media branch with a bachelor.
