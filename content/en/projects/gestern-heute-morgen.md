This is my final project (diploma thesis) back from my school days.
Together with a colleague, we decided to create a fictitious exhibition about the alumni of the «Graphische».
I took over the exhibition catalog, while my colleague Hana Stein planned the exhibition and transformed it into a three-dimensional space.
Afterwards we wrote biographies about the artists who were once students at the school.
We even found artists like Trude Fleischmann or Margit Doppler, who were already creatively active in the 1910s and 1920s.

My task was to create a catalog for the exhibition.
In total, I assembled over 30 artists, all of whom were immortalized in this catalog with their biographies and works.
