    first: 'Hello! My name is Magdalena Jirku and I am a visual effects artist and graphic designer living in Vienna, Austria. I first came in touch with compositing and design as a student when I went to the «Höhere Graphische Bundes- Lehr und Versuchsanstalt» where I finished my A levels and got a diploma in graphic & communication design. I later on started visiting the «SAE Institute» in Vienna to study visual effects and 3D animations. I have already finished my diploma and I am aiming to obtain a bachelor''s degree in March 2023.'
